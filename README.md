# Project - Chief People Officer

This is an example of Supervised Learning using Classification

Project Scope:
Our client is at a HR department at a large software company. They are rolling out a new initiative that they call, "Proactive Retention". The idea is to use data, to predict whether an employee is likely to leave. Once these employees are identified HR can be more productive in reaching out to them before it's too late. For this intitiative, they only care about permanent (non temporary employees)
Currently, their employee retention process is very retrospective. Once an employee leaves he/she takes an exit interview. HR then tries to learn insights from that interview and to make changes around the company accordingly.


Our role: Build a model to predict the probablity that a current employee would leave. We have been given a dataset with information about employees. Both employeed and left. Our task is to build a classification model using that dataset.


Specifics:
Machine Learning task: Classification model
Target variable: Status (Left/Employeed)
Input variables: Refer to data dictionary file - "Data Dictionary - Chief People Officer"
Success Criteria: N/A. Best possible model. Since there is no baseline or precedent, we do not have a quantifiable measure.


This project will be carried out in 4 stages
1. Exploratory Data Analysis: Data understanding and generating insights
2. Data Cleaning & Data Preparation: Preparing data for Modelling
3. Data Modelling: Experimenting with classification algorithms
4. Model Evaluation: Verifying using performance metrics
